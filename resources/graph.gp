# data format of a line: label_of_vertex [array_of_neighbor_distance pairs]
# Following graph is a directed graph with 3 vertices where every vertice is has an edge to other ones.
# 
# tokat's ID is zero since it is our first vertex
# it is connected to vertex ID 1 and this edge has a length of 120
# it is connected to vertex ID 2 and this edge has a length Ä±f 1000
